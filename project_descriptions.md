## CDA 4910 Projects


### Group 1 (Insight into Prison Specialist Care and Recidivism)
(Jordan Douglass and Oliver Bennett)

The main goal for this project is to understand the prison care system and find any correlations between existing prison data and data on the general population in Florida as well as correlations surrounding prisons and social determinants of health in a given county. 
As a team, we aim to use the meaningful information gathered to better understand the incarceration system in our state and how certain aspects affect recidivism outcomes.
