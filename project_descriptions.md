# Project Proposal : Relocation Station
## Erich Grennan-Mengore & Natalie Brum



### *Intruduction*

 
Our project idea is to help newly graduated Data Science major to find the best match of city to live in based on the criteria of Cost Of Living, Weather, and Climate.
 
 

### *Description of the problem*
 
The problem we are trying to solve is how does a college graduate determine the ideal city to live in depending on what they are looking for in a city. Considering the current state of the economy, gone are the days where you can choose a random city and hope to make money just from being big. Job markets have become competitive, rent keeps on going up, and the cost of daily necessities can fluctuate at any moment.
 
  

### *Timeline*
  
  Midterm:
  
	- Initial Research
  
	- Determine data sources
  
	- Initial analysis of data (EDA)
  
	- Final modification of data sources
  
	- Determine analysis methods that could be used 
  
	- Additional research
  
	- Final draft for designt
 


  Final:
  
	- Start development 
 
	- Create initial version
  
	- Testing
  
	- Additional features
 
	- Use Shiny application displaying to show analysis and data visualization
 


### *Data sources*
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reisanar/datasets/master/cost-of-living-2018.csv - Cost of Living Data for 2018 obtained by Professor Sanchez-Arias from numbeo.com, which was placed on github.

* https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm - Data from department of labor on permenant foreign residents within the United State. Since foreign workers are required to post their actual pay it helps gauge the actual types of salaries companies are giving, instead of survey data from places like Glassdoor.

* https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1&acrdn=8#reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1 - Regional price parity in 2016 compiled by the BEA

* https://www.thereadystore.com/natural-disasters-map# - Natural Disaster Locations

* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geonames/index.html - Allows for the ability to query the Geonames database to obtain the Latitude and Longitude of a city.

* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GSODR/vignettes/GSODR.html - Used to obtain climate and weather data from NOAA, then using that to attach averages of climate variables to the data set.
